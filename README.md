### Code overview for Assignment #3- MSDS 492- David Van Dyke

The markdown section in the *.ipynb files explains the function of each of the code block.  This README file contains a quick background on each of the sections.  If you have any trouble running the code, please reach out to let me know.  Thanks Dave Van Dyke
1. Section #1 Downloads the last ~6 years of data yfinance data for the assets into an Excel Worksheet. (SPY SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, PSX Phillips 66; VLO Valero Energy Corporation; MPC Marathon Petroleum Corporation, CL=F WTI Crude Oil Futures (NYMEX);  GLD SPDR Gold Shares ETF, EUR/USD exchange rate()
2. Section #2.  This code block reads the Excel Files with the stock data into Pandas Dataframes.  
3. Section #3- Is a quick EDA section to get a feel for the data.  It is not part of the assignment but included for reference and assisting when setting up the assignment requirements.  This generates a pdf data report
4. Section #4- Completes the feature engineering for the additional calculations to verify stylized fact of financial markets for the assets.
5. Section #5-  This is a quick EDA section on the engineered featrues dataframes

 AI was used for both code customization and report analysis.  The work is my own from customizing and coordinating with the AI output.
